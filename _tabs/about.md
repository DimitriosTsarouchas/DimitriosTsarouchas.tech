Welcome to my personal website! 

My name is Dimitris, I am a Cybersecurity graduate and Information Engineering professional with years of experience in private sectors. 

Here I upload content about cybersecurity, practical examples such as capture the flags (CTFs) and other IT stuff I find useful, and share it to people who are interested in cybersecurity.
