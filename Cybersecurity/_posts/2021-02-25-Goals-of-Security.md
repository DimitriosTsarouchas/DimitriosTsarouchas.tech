## Introduction

In general, computer security has to deal with the functionality, security, and the resources that an organisation has available, to ensure both are working in balance. Now, by saying functionality we mean that the systems must function as users need them to function, so they can interact with the data needed. Security simply means that an organisation increases the protection levels for its systems and data.  

This relationship between functionality and security is inversely proportional, therefore, the more security the less functionality for an organisation. Another factor is the resources meaning that the less resources an organisation has available, the less functionality or security can afford.

### CIA Triad
The theory of security follows three goals: protect the Confidentiality of data, preserve the Integrity of data, and ensure the Availability of data, most commonly known as the CIA triad. Nonetheless, a big percentage of security professionals believe that CIA triad is not enough so there are two more goals added, that is Auditing and Accountability, and Non-repudiation.

#### Confidentiality
The first goal of security is confidentiality and what that means is to protect the systems and data from not being interacted with somebody who is not authorised to do so. Organisations can use various means to achieve confidentiality; one of them could be encryption.
#### Integrity
The goal of integrity is the requirement of the systems and data to be maintained unaltered while they are stored, transmitted, processed, and received. Integrity also has three goals: prevent from unauthorised modification, alteration, and creation or deletion of data.
#### Availability
The third goal, availability, applies when an organisation tries to ensure that systems and data are available, whenever authorised users need them to perform authorised tasks. Ensuring that users have a secure and functional system available at any time ensures availability. 
Examples of ensuring availability could be business continuity, or data backup.

Now we can see how critical the CIA triad is for security professionals; at any time in the security world a security professional ask this question “Have I achieved one of the 3 goals of security by implementing that?” 
#### Auditing and Accountability
This goal deals with the monitoring and keeping track of things that happens on systems. For example, “who logged in the windows server the last hour?”, “when they were logged in?”, “who accessed these data?” and so on…
#### Non-repudiation
This goal means that users cannot deny that they performed a particular action on a system. Non-repudiation in communications ensures that a user cannot deny that had made some form of communication.
