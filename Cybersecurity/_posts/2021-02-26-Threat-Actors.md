## Threat Actor types and Attributes  
When we talk about threat actors we mean those people or organisations that actually attack an organisation’s infrastructure.
Security operations teams must ensure that an organisation stays informed and battles against any type of threat actor. Therefore, security professionals must apply a solid defensive strategy against an intelligent threat actor whose real intent is to cause damage to an organisation and not just a potential event. To understand the real threat SOC teams must consider the tactics, techniques, and procedures of intelligent threat actors. 

Before we look into threat actors it is important to understand threat actors' attribute types.
### Internal or External 
People that threaten an infrastructure and are within the organisation are considered as internals whereas externals are people outside the organisation, for example, someone attacking the organisation from a foreign country.
### Level of sophistication
People who are well sophisticated in computing and networking such as an APT (coming later in the article…) can do to really big damage to a system.
### Resources and funding
There must be lots of resources such as computers, skilled people and a lot of times it can take tremendous amounts of money, for attacks to be successful and truly damage an organisation.
### Intent
The intent is what motivates attackers to do what they do against an organisation or individuals, in other words, what is their goal. For example, attackers might deface a website to send a warning message indicating their existence to their target and its audience.
### Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
Nowadays OSINT became easy for attackers as they can use publicly available information and social media in order to get enough information about their targets.
Open-source intelligence is actually the art of collecting information from public sources, particularly the internet. Intelligence and military organisations are actively engaged in OSINT activities to collect information about their targets. 
There are two types of OSINT: the offensive that deals with the harvesting of all the required data in order to prepare the attack field, and the defensive that deals with the collection of data leaked in previous breaches and any other security incidents relevant to the target.

*Threat Actors*

A threat actor is actually a malicious person and/or organisation whose intention is to harm or gain profit from organisations or individuals. An example of a threat actor would be a hacker who violates the security of an organisation or a system to access corporate secrets and use them for their benefit. Also, a respected member of an organisation can be considered as a threat actor if he has just enough access to the IT infrastructure, but lacks the knowledge of what not to do. Here the word actor means simply something or someone that can initiate a negative event.

    2. Script Kiddies 
    3. Organised Cybercrime
    4. Nation-state/APT
    5. Insiders
    6. Competitors

### Hacktivists
A Hacktivist is a combination of hacker and activist that has some form of agenda, often political or fuelled by a sense of justice. Intent and motivation really come into play along with this type of threat actor. 

### Script Kiddies 
Script Kiddies are people with a trivial amount of attack knowledge who take advantage of easy-to-use scripts and premade tools to perform attacks. They usually lack sophistication which makes them, most of the time, easy to be found and blocked, for example by the use of good firewall settings and good base system controls.

### Organised Cybercrime
Organised Cybercrime is actually groups of very smart, sophisticated, and well-funded people working together to make a profit and is a big issue an organisation has to deal with.

### Nation-state/APT
Probably the biggest single threat these days are Nation-state actors where an entire country has a job, to get tremendous amounts of resources and sophistication in order to get more intelligence. An good example of a nation-state actor could be that country A sends spies to country B to gather intelligence. 
Whereas organised crime commonly uses threats specifically to make money, nation-states take advantage of vulnerabilities to acquire intelligence. Nation-states have the resources, people, and money to collect OSINT successfully. One big thing these organisations go for is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). An APT is a form of threat that gets into a system and they stay there, they are persistent. 

### Insiders
Insiders are people who are inside the company usually have user accounts that give them access to assets but it doesn’t always have to be an employee. It could be someone that is within the infrastructure or a vendor that is working inside the organisation’s infrastructure. Therefore whoever has access to organisation’s information should be treated as an insider.

### Competitors
Competitors may have been a big issue maybe ten to even fifteen years ago and they simply try to gain more customers or audience by taking advantage of the targeted organisation.
